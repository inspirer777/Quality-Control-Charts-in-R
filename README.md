# Statistical Process Control with X-bar and R Charts in R

## Description
This project includes code for generating quality control charts (Control Charts) using the R programming language and the `qcc` package. These charts are essential tools for monitoring and analyzing processes to detect potential variations in performance.

## Features
- Generate **X-bar** charts for data with a sample size of 1.
- Generate **X-bar** charts for larger sample sizes.
- Generate **R** charts to analyze the range of variations in the data.
- Read data from an Excel file for analysis.

## How to Use
1. Make sure the following R packages are installed:
   - `qcc`
   - `readxl`

2. Update the file path for your Excel file in the following section of the script:
